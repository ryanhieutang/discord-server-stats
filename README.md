# About the project
With the fustration of public discord bots not having the option to customise your stat channels, I came to the conclusion to why make one myself and adapt it into [Million Token's Server](https://twitter.com/Million__Token)

Please show your support by reacting with `watch` or ‚≠ê

### Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)

# **I. Mechanism**
Through the help of discord's official module, discord.js, I was able freely interact with it's API through js like how a normal individual would use the desktop app. After collecting the significant IDs of each needed channels/roles, I used a command to search for how many people had that certain requirement (e.g. how many people were online). After scraping the numbers, I manipulated the channel's name to be that certain number and made it repeat that line of command for X milliseconds.

# **II. Why you should use it?**
Why should I use this source code instead of easily inviting a bot to my server to do it for me? The answer is simple, personal satisfactions. I believe that everyone would rather customise certain things themselves without having to pay each month just to change the channel template name.
